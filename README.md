Kali Updater
-----------------------------
This is a very simple update script if you don't feel like updating yourself manually with commands. This is incredibly easy to set up and even creates a desktop launcher that you can click on from the applications menu. All you need to do is download all the files into the same folder, then "chmod a+x installer.sh" and finally "./installer.sh" to install the application. Sweet and simple.
